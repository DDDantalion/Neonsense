Hi folks. This is a FREE gunshot sample pack of 16bit, 44.1khz stereo wav sound effects and can be for any non-commercial use.

These sounds are the result of mixing and editing together a large library of sounds found all over the web. They were created iteratively to produce a final gunshot sound for 40 different military firearms. There were many more iterations, so I've reduced the most similar ones down to the amount found here in this pack. 

Here you'll find a total of 403 wav files across 40 different weapons. Most of the 40 weapons contain at least one suppressed version and at least one distance version. Some weapons contain over 10 similar or totally different versions. Enjoy exploring all the options!
